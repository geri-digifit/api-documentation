Send a GET request to `https://api.virtuagym.com/api/v1/club/<club_id>/member?api_key=<api_key>&club_secret=<club_key>&sync_from=<sync_from>` OR `https://api.virtuagym.com/api/v1/club/<club_id>/member?api_key=<api_key>&club_secret=<club_key>&from_id=<from_id>`

In some cases the it is better to use `from_id` as multiple rows might have the same `sync_from` thereby not allowing for pagination. For the first call when using `from_id` it is allowed to pass 0 and it would allow for pagination.

        }
    ]
}
```

It is also possible to retrieve the member from any of the other sub-clubs as well by passing `any_sub_club=1` in the URL parameter. For this case, remember to use the `club_secret` of the super club.

Therefore, for this call it should be something similar to :

`/api/v1/club/<other-club-id>/member/<member_id>?api_key=<api_key>&club_secret=<super_club_key>&any_sub_club=1`

And would return the response of the member details from the original club where his profile was first created.

In addition to retrieving the member resource itself, we allow for retrieving sub-resource using the `with` URL parameter for saving on making two separate requests.

At the moment, the valid `with` values are :

|`with` Value|Description|
|---|---|
|memberships|returns all memberships the member currently has (both active/inactive)|
|active_memberships|all active memberships of the member|

For instance send a GET request to:

`/api/v1/club/<club-id>/member/<member_id>?api_key=<api_key>&club_secret=<club_key>&with=memberships`

would return something similar to

```json

## PUT Example

The PUT request allows to both update an existing member and create a new member.

When using this request to create a new member, they will automatically get e-mail invites based upon the club setting.

* PUT ``/api/v1/club/<club_id>/member/`` would create a new member returning a ``member_id`` in the process.

  A simple implementation for creating a member in PHP - 
https://github.com/virtuagym/Virtuagym-Public-API/blob/master/php/member-creation-v1.php

* PUT ``/api/v1/club/<club_id>/member/<member_id>`` would update an existing member with the given ``member_id``.

```json
{
 "firstname":"John",
 "lastname":"Doe",
 "email":"john@example.com",
 "external_id": "1ABC234567",
 "level_id": 2,
 "goal_id": 4,
 "filled_intake_questionnaire": 0
}
```
which would return a response as follows
```json
{
  "status": {
    "statuscode": 201,
    "statusmessage": "Everything OK",
    "result_count": 10,
    "timestamp": 1478252652810
  },
  "result": {
    "member_id": 77338,
    "firstname": "John",
    "lastname": "Doe",
    "email": "john@example.com",
    "external_id": "1ABC234567",
    "active": true,
    "is_pro": false,
    "gender": "m",
    "member_since": 1478127600000,
    "timestamp_edit": 1478252652,
    "filled_mandatory_intake_questionnaire": 0
  }
}
```
*Note* When you **update an existing member** with an external_id **statuscode 200** should be expected. In case there are more members with the same external_id within the club the API return the error 420 (More members with external Id).



## Transfer a member to another subclub

In some cases, clubs need to move members between subclubs without manual re-entry or imports. This endpoint allows a member to be reassigned from one subclub to another, preserving their core profile data.  

### Example: Move Member from Subclub1 to Subclub2

A member originally in Subclub1 is going to be transferred to Subclub2. Below is the member’s current info:

```json
{
  "firstname": "John",
  "lastname": "Doe",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "external_id": "member_extid123",
  "club_external_id": "externalid_subclub1"
}
```

Superclub and subclubs configuration:

| club_id | club name | club_external_id     |
|---------|-----------|----------------------|
| 104     | superclub | externalid_superclub |
| 105     | subclub1  | externalid_subclub1  |
| 106     | subclub2  | externalid_subclub2  |

#### Important before the transfer

- All clubs involved in the transfer must have a valid `club_external_id` set.  
- The member being transferred must have a valid `external_id` set.
- Memberships, credits, and notes are **not** transferred and must be handled separately.

To perform the transfer from **Subclub1** to **Subclub2**, send a `PUT` request to:

```
https://virtuagym.com/api/v1/club/<club_id>/member/create_or_update?api_key=<api_key>&club_secret=<club_secret>
```

Make sure to replace `<club_id>` with the **ID of the superclub**. As well as the corresponding superclub `<api_key>` and `<club_secret>`.

A minimum request body like the following should be provided:

```json
{
  "external_id": "member_extid123",
  "club_external_id": "externalid_subclub2"
}
```

This will transfer the member’s original profile to **Subclub2**, as identified by `club_external_id`.

### Successful Response

```json
{
  "status": {
    "statuscode": 200,
    "statusmessage": "Everything OK",
    "result_count": 13,
    "timestamp": 1749202114488
  },
  "result": {
    "member_id": 12345,
    "external_id": "member_extid123",
    "firstname": "John",
    "lastname": "Doe",
    "active": true,
    "is_pro": true,
    "gender": "m",
    "email": "john@example.com",
    "member_since": 1749160800000,
    "timestamp_edit": 1749202114488,
    "club_id": 106,
    "lang": "en",
    "original_member_id": 0
  }
}
```

After the successful transfer, the member will appear in **Subclub2** as their new main club, which can be validated by `"club_id": 106` in the response.

To move the member again, simply make the same request, changing the `club_external_id` field to the new target subclub.

## Activate user account for member
### POST Example
* POST ``/api/v1/club/<club_id>/member/activate_user`` This endpoint will activate the user profile for a club’s member or allow that member to connect to an existing profile through the API.

Note: The endpoint is not restricted to member_id to find the member; it is very flexible in it search criteria for a member and so can perform activation on external identifiers such as external_id, email, rfid tag or club member id or any combination of them (as an AND search. OR it's not supported).

The only restrictions are that only one member is found at the end, and that the member belongs to the club specified by the club id in the url (or club chain when the club specified is a superclub).
