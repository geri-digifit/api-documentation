Send a GET request to `https://api.virtuagym.com/api/v1/club/<club_id>/employee?api_key=<api_key>&club_secret=<club_key>&sync_from=<sync_from>` OR `https://api.virtuagym.com/api/v1/club/<club_id>/employee?api_key=<api_key>&club_secret=<club_key>&from_id=<from_id>`

In some cases the it is better to use `from_id` as multiple rows might have the same `sync_from` thereby not allowing for pagination. For the first call when using `from_id` it is allowed to pass 0 and it would allow for pagination.

```json
{
    "statuscode": 200,
    "statusmessage": "Everything OK",
    "result_count": 2,
    "timestamp": 1429522483,
    "result": [
      {
            "member_id": 7302399,
            "firstname": "Claudiu2",
            "lastname": "Dorado",
            "email": "radu+wtfs9925@digifit.eu",
            "active": true,
            "gender": "m",
            "member_since": 1526508000000,
            "timestamp_edit": 1526549160788,
            "lang": "en",
            "club_id": 377,
            "priviliges": "default,club_manager"
        }
    ]
}
```

It is also possible to retrieve the employee from any of the other sub-clubs as well by passing `any_sub_club=1` in the URL parameter. For this case, remember to use the `club_secret` of the super club.

Therefore, for this call it should be something similar to :

`/api/v1/club/<other-club-id>/employee/<member_id>?api_key=<api_key>&club_secret=<super_club_key>&any_sub_club=1`

And would return the response of the employee details from the original club where his profile was first created.

When using this request to create a new employee, they will automatically get e-mail invites based upon the club setting.

```json
{
"firstname":"John",

    "statuscode": 200,
    "statusmessage": "Everything OK",
    "result_count": 9,
    "timestamp": 1478252652810

  "statusmessage": "Not found.",
  "result_count": 0,
  "timestamp": 1439302743

"gender": "f",
"birthday": "1984-11-28",
